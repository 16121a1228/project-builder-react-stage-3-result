# ProGrad PROJECT BUILDER | REACT - QUIZ STAGE II - DYNAMIC RENDER

## Learning Goals

In this exercise, the goal is to learn building a complete quiz app on a stage by stage basis:

- props and state,
- how to work with event handlers.
- work with maps and filters
- work with json object.

## Getting started

In the end of this document, you will find guidelines on how to submit the exercise.

### Introduction

We will continue to improve our code from where we left previously. We will work on the Quiz component today. We will calculate the scores and display in the result component. 

**Note: use rcc to generate the code template.**.  

So let's get started!

### PROGRESSION 4 | I WANT TO QUIT
When the user clicks the quit button, the question should stop getting displayed.
